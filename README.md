### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Changhyun Bae, a software engineer who started out as a backend developer in June 2016 and later transitioned into frontend development. My first step into frontend was through projects using Vue and Nuxt.js. Sometimes I still miss Vueâ€™s single-file component structure and its intuitive two-way binding.   
These days, I primarily work with the React ecosystem.   
I also worked as a frontend instructor at a coding bootcamp. Sharing my knowledge with students and watching them grow was an incredibly rewarding experience â€” and it helped me grow alongside them.

If you're curious about what Iâ€™m working on or thinking about, feel free to check out my tech blog below!   
Thank you for reading!
