### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Changhyun Bae, a software engineer who began my career as a backend developer in June 2016 and later transitioned into frontend development.    
My journey into the frontend world started with building web services using Vue and Nuxt.js, and has since expanded to a broader React-based tech stack. I also have experience as a lead frontend instructor at a coding bootcamp, where I shared my knowledge and passion for creating intuitive user experiences.

If you're interested in my work or thoughts on frontend development, feel free to check out my tech blog below!
